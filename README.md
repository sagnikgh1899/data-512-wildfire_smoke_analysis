# DATA 512: Human Centered Data Science (Autumn 2023)

- Could not add the main data file: Mention how to get it and store it in details
- Could not upload the processed file. Mention how the code will generate that and save it under intermediate data folder

## Best practices for documentation
- PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code ([Reference link](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/))
- Use of relative path addresses to help in reproducibility
- Use of intuitive variable and function names to ease in understanding
- Appropriate comments and documentation provided for the data aquisition, data processing and data analysis steps
