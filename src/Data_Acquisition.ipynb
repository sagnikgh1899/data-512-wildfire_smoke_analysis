    "## Distance computations with Pyproj\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue in performing geodetic computation is that any (all) geographic coordinate systems are eventually translated to the surface of the earth - which is not flat. That means every computation of distance between two points is some kind of arc (not actually a straight line). Further the earth is not a true sphere, its a type of ellipsoid. That means the amount of curvature varies depending upon where we are on the surface and the direction - which changes the distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucky for us there are geographers who like to write code and have built systems to simplify the computation of distances over the earth's surface. One of those systems is called [Pyproj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/index.html). It has functions that will convert coordinate points between (almost) any two of the many different geographic coordinate systems. As well, Pyproj provides ways to compute distances between two points (mostly assuming the points are already in the same coordinate system).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses the Geod() object to calculate the distance between a slected starting city and all of the cities defined in our CITY_LOCATIONS dictionary (see CONSTANTS above).\n",
    "\n",
    "The example calls the distances computed 'straight line' distances - because that is what we would have to use to find the distance between two cities using Google. If we didn't use some form of language like that Google would map roads to get us between a source and destination; that would never match our calculation.\n"

One issue is that fires are irregularly shaped so the actual answer to that is a bit dependent upon the exact shape and how we want to think about the notion of 'distance'. For example, should we just find the closest point on the perimiter of a fire and call that the distance? Maybe we should find the centroid of the region, identify that as a geolocation (coordinate) and then calculate the distance to that? We can come up with numerous other ways.\n",
